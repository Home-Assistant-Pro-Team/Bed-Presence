# Bed-Presence

Bed occupancy sensor (bedprence) configurable with zigbee
Hi everyone, I am excited to present a project.

First of all, because we started the project... We were looking for a battery-powered zigbee sensor to put under the mattress, we found some interesting ideas but none seemed reliable or did not have the features we wanted for the sensor, for example some sensors need to be under the blankets, but our idea was a sensor under the mattress. So after much thought and testing, we came up with this idea:

The bed sensor is mainly a 3d printed structure with a switch that closes the zigbee circuit. *You have to put it under the mattress and set the right switch elevation with the knob*. After a week, the 3d printed structure will probably warp slightly and you will have to reset the elevation, after which it will remain stable.

I hope you all will enjoy our sensor and if anyone does not have a 3d printer we can print it for you with a small charge by emailing bn87marco@gmail.com

Materials Needed:
- Micro Switch
- M6 nut with 6Ã—20 hexagonal screw
- 2 compression springs
